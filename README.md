- Lab instructions had a walkthrough to connect local machine and github repo, and when/where to create the files and venv. They did not specify to branch until the README portion of the submission instructions, so I finished and didn't know I was supposed to branch until now. I will review the final submission instructions tomorrow, prior to beginning my coding.
